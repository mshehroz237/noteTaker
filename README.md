# Note Taker Starter Code

In this project i created a server.js file. i went ahead by first creating a route to homepage. Then i created routes for the page where i can add notes. Then i used node random id package to add ids to every new object that gtes added to the array.Then i created a post mehtod, in that method i gave every whatevers inside the body a uniuqe id by using the npm package. To add data first i used readfile to read the json file wehre its going to be added. and set it to a variable. Then converted that into json file using parse and set it to another object. Created a variable and set the incoming content to that. Since now it has been converted to into an array object used .push to push the new content to the json file. Then stringlified that data and used write file to add it to the json file.
